Group 7 Project 1 local music app


Main stated goal - find live music close to you, sorted by distance/genre. To accomplish this we want to use BandsInTown API and Google Maps, as well as integrating some kind of music preview to play a 30 second clip.

General Overview:
  1. Use Google Maps to geolocate the user.
  2. Query SongKick or SeatGeek API for shows related to location of user
  3. Pull information about shows that day
  4. Try to pull genre as well, to enable sorting by genre.
  5. Populate a list/table/whatever with links that show the artist/genre/show details/directions(?)/music preview.
  6. If possible, try to populate travel time vs. start time.
  7. That's all I got so far
